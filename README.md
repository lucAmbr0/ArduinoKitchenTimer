- This is my second Arduino project. In this project I made a simple kitchen timer using some buttons, a LCD display, an active buzzer and two leds. Hope you'll like my work :)

About me:
- Just a 15yo guy who loves wasting his free time trying to learn something new about computer technology.
- Posting totally random tech stuff, I enjoy useless things too difficult for me.
